# JustQuant - Data analysis on potentcial customers
## Goal
The goal is to utilize data analytical technics to expand the students' amount from train boot camp service. Also, I also extract data from Google Analytics to see whether there are any possible business model could be found according to the footprint of the website.

## Process
### Define metrics
Define the metric: So, for the training boot camp, I defined whether people are going buy the boot camp service. As for the finding new business model, I define the percentage of people who view the product page and each browsing duration of the product page as metrics.   
### Pick the variables & model
Pick the variables & model: After that, I took some of the user characteristics such as gender, age, and professional background. Also, I picked the browsing behaviors such as duration time in each browse as my features. Then, I choose Random Forest Classifier since it worked well in with categorical variables, and it handled non-linear features.   

## Result Intepretation
Output:  After inspecting my model, I saw that users from age 30 â€“ 50 with a technical background such as software engineer were more likely to purchase the service. Besides, the attendance rate of the seminar was twice higher during weekdays.  On the other hand, people with under 30 years old were very engaged, but due to income issue, they usually ended up with not purchasing the service. The next step I use data visualization tools such as tableau to collaborate with marketing teams and change the strategy on the seminar and the audience of the advertisement.
